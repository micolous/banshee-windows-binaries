# banshee-windows-binaries #

This repository contains needed binaries (GTK, GStreamer, and .NET bindings for each) for building Banshee on Windows.

It **does not** contain Windows binaries for Banshee itself.

Please note that Banshee on Windows is an **alpha-quality technology preview**, and has [many known bugs](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query=product%3Abanshee%20os%3Awindows).

See:

* [Instructions for building Banshee on Windows](http://banshee.fm/download/development/#windows)
* [Binaries for Banshee itself](http://banshee.fm/download/) (the lazy option)
